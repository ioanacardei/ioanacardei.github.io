Hello my name is Ioana Cardei and I am a data scientist and physical therapist. My unique journey has brought me from the world of Physical Therapy to the forefront of Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. My transition into data science is driven by a passion for leveraging technology to solve complex problems and a desire to merge my healthcare expertise with cutting-edge data science and analytics. I recieved my Masters in Science from [Florida Atlantic University](https://www.fau.edu) with a minor in Artificial Intelligence and certificate in Big Data. 

After earning my Doctor of Physical Therapy degree in 2020 from [University of Florida](https://www.uf.edu) and practicing as a healthcare provider, I developed a deep appreciation for the impact of data on patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency. This sparked my interest in data science, leading me to pursue a Master of Science in Data Science and Analytics at [Florida Atlantic University](https://www.fau.edu) from the depeartment of Engineering and Computer Science. Here, I focused on Data Science and Engineering, with a minor in Artificial Intelligence, and achieved a 4.0 GPA while independently managing my patient caseload and working as a physical therapist. 

During my graduate studies, I immersed myself in courses such as Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Data Mining and Machine Learning, Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis using Python, Natural Language Processing, Artifical Intelligence and Predictive Analytics. These courses equipped me with the skills to develop and implement advanced machine learning models, analyze vast datasets, and derive actionable insights. My technical proficiency includes Python, R and tools like TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, GGplot, Seaborn, ChatGPT and PyTorch.

My background as a healthcare provider has enriched my perspective, allowing me to approach data science with a human-centric focus. My experience managing caseloads, developing personalized treatment plans, and collaborating with interdisciplinary teams has honed my analytical and problem-solving skills. I now aim to drive innovative solutions and support informed decision-making across diverse industries to make a meaningful impact.

I am excited to bring my unique blend of healthcare experience and data science skills to a position where I can contribute to innovative projects, solve real-world problems, and help shape the future of technology and its applications in diverse fields.
